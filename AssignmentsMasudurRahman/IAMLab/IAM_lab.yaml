            ----Lab 3.1.1: IAM Role----

    Created an IAM role and attached inline Policies, provided the Role read-only access to all IAM resources.
    Listed all the Roles and Describe the specific Role was created using the following two commands
            To list: aws iam list-roles
            To describe the role: iam get-role --role-name Assignment01
            ---Lab 3.1.2: Customer Managed Policy----

    Converted the inline policy to seperate customer managed policy
    Then attached the customer managed policy to the IAM role
            ---Lab 3.1.4: AWS-Managed Policies----

    Created another IAM role and reused the customer managed policy which was converted from inline policy. Additionally updated the description to mention the policy was being reused
            ---Lab 3.1.4: AWS-Managed Policies---

    Replaced the customer managed policy by the AWS Managed Policy to both roles granting Read permissions to the IAM service.
            ---Lab 3.1.5: Policy Simulator----

    Used the AWS Policy Simulator to simulate the ability of each role to perform the mentioned actions.
            ---Lab 3.1.6: Clean Up--- Deleted the roles and policy

            Lesson 3.2: Trust Relationships & Assuming Roles

    - Created an IAM role with read only access
    - Switched user using the account number and name
    - Attempted to create a S3 bucked and it failed due to lack of permission
    - Added privileges by providing the s3 full access, I was able to create a bucket
    - Successfully added a .txt file to the bucket
    - As user I was able to list the buckets but not added the .txt file due to permission
